* [RuntimeReprogram](../tree/master/RuntimeReprogram) - the beginnings of the ALERT task of reprogramming a mote at runtime without modifications required to the core Deluge code.
* [unorganized resources](../tree/master/unorganized%20resources/)
  * [Chinmay's Code Switching](../tree/master/unorganized%20resources/ChinmaysCodeSwitching) - retained code from Chinmay Lokesh for reference.
  * [DelugeV](../tree/master/unorganized%20resources/DelugeV) - versioning code performing in Dr. Olariu's 2010 Sensor Networks class, as obtained from Chinmay
  * [MikeRuffingSource](../tree/master/unorganized%20resources/MikeRuffingSource) - official versioning code obtained from Mike Ruffing, one of the versioning project's creators
  * [Retasking Project](../tree/master/unorganized%20resources/RetaskingProject) - supposed portion of source of versioning code from Chinmay
